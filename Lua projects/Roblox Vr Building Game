  Roblox runs on a very lightly modified version of lua called luau
  I learned alot about vector math from this one, and also just about lua in general
  I unfortantantly lost the ability to run it after roblox's entire game engine for vr got overhauled and all the code broke, but it was simply a game in roblox where you used vr 
and built by stretching a block to make it bigger and you held it and placed it down
  I also dont have any real footage of it, with it being made over summer last year before I really thought that any of my projects could be good enough to belong in a 
portfolio
  the only video I have relating to it is this which shows how it would calculate how it should stretch, which I took a while to make because I simply could not stretch
  it from the hands position to the blocks orgin as that would make it longer if the hand was off to the side, so I had to use some vector math to get used to itu
